# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Group Members: Cole Elsasser, Vincent Li, Brian Chiang

This repository includes the proposal.html and proposal.css which create the webpage to detail the features of our 
proposed application "Seattle is FUN". The corresponding gh-page can be found at https://info340b-sp24.github.io/project-Elsasc/proposal.html

This current project includes the static mockups of all aspects of our slides.
Within you will find 
- Index page which serves as the home page where all location cards are listed
- A timeline where a timeline can be made by a user to plan out their travels
- A quiz to give you reccommended tags that a user might want to pursue. 
- A quiz results page showing the recommendation (static)
- A liked location pages demonstrating where users could find locations they had previously hit the "like" button on 

Current static mockup gh-pages link: https://info340b-sp24.github.io/project-Elsasc/proposal.html


Notes for project draft 1: 

To navigate to quiz-results page click submit quiz button (at bottom of quiz page)

The other .css files are remnants from earlier and can be ignored, all css from those files is aggregated in the style.css page which is the stylesheet used by all pages.

Script to include bootstrap appears as an error in html checker but this was where I was told to place it by Professor (also it is still functional for implementing bootstrap)

As discussed with Professor one of our pages (timeline) primarily functions with html while the rest use bootstrap primarily. This was approved by the Professor and he asked that I note it here.
