      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
      The general topic that we are covering is aggregating notable travel locations in Seattle Washington. 
      We are aiming to solve the problem that we hear from many traveling to Seattle for the first time, which 
      is that they can never find things to do in Seattle! Many travelers have difficulty finding attractions or 
      locations in Washington as we have fewer well-known landmarks than many other travel cities. We hope to increase 
      tourism across Seattle and notably to businesses/locations that might be less populated due to lack of visibility or publicity. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Users have a difficult time finding attractions that specifically cater to their hobbies/preferences and oftentimes donâ€™t 
        have a means of finding these locations amongst so many different places recommended online. There is a difficulty in finding an easy-to-navigate
        aggregated location for Seattle area visitor locations.Our system aims to fufill the lack of a simple one-stop site to find all 
        interesting Seattle shops, parks, attractions, and locations. 
      </p>


      <p>
      Existing solutions such as the <a href="https://stateofwatourism.com/washington-state-visitors-guide/" target="_blank">Washington Government's Visitors Guide</a> 
      lacks a dynamic interface and can be difficult to navigate and find their write ups detailing a few locations. 
      While this does provide fairly comprehensive information and write-ups about the locations listed they are separated by various different 
      tabs and sections that can make it difficult to find exactly what one is looking for. 
      As far as general information on city locations, reviewer services like <cite><a href="https://www.yelp.com">Yelp</cite></a> provide  
      this information but suffer from the opposite problem as the government visitor guide. Their lists 
      are often so comprehensive and exhaustive that it can be difficult to pick a location as nearly every Seattle business is 
      listed, meaning interesting travel spots can be lost amongst all the other information.
