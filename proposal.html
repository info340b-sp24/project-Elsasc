    <h1>Seattle is FUN!</h1>
    <p>--Cole Elsasser, Brian Chiang, Vincent Li</p>

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
      The general topic that we are covering is aggregating notable travel locations in Seattle Washington.
      We are aiming to solve the problem that we hear from many traveling to Seattle for the first time, which
      is that they can never find things to do in Seattle! Many travelers have difficulty finding attractions or
      locations in Washington as we have fewer well-known landmarks than many other travel cities. We hope to increase
      tourism across Seattle and notably to businesses/locations that might be less populated due to lack of visibility or publicity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users have a difficult time finding attractions that specifically cater to their hobbies/preferences and oftentimes donâ€™t
        have a means of finding these locations amongst so many different places recommended online. There is a difficulty in finding an easy-to-navigate
        aggregated location for Seattle area visitor locations.Our system aims to fufill the lack of a simple one-stop site to find all
        interesting Seattle shops, parks, attractions, and locations.
      </p>


      <p>
      Existing solutions such as the <a href="https://stateofwatourism.com/washington-state-visitors-guide/" target="_blank">Washington Government's Visitors Guide</a>
      lacks a dynamic interface and can be difficult to navigate and find their write ups detailing a few locations.
      While this does provide fairly comprehensive information and write-ups about the locations listed they are separated by various different
      tabs and sections that can make it difficult to find exactly what one is looking for.
      As far as general information on city locations, reviewer services like <cite><a href="https://www.yelp.com">Yelp</cite></a> provide
      this information but suffer from the opposite problem as the government visitor guide. Their lists
      are often so comprehensive and exhaustive that it can be difficult to pick a location as nearly every Seattle business is
      listed, meaning interesting travel spots can be lost amongst all the other information.

      <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
      <p>
        The users of the application will primarily be travelers visiting Seattle who are seeking guidance on where to go and what
        activities would be enjoyable to them. This could include tourists from various backgrounds, both domestic and international,
        as well as individuals traveling for business or other purposes who have some leisure time to explore the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        When considering the potential impacts of the app on minority groups, it's important to recognize that minority travelers may face 
        unique challenges and considerations when navigating a new city. For instance, minority groups may seek destinations and activities 
        that reflect their cultural backgrounds or interests. The app should strive to offer diverse recommendations that include a wide range of options.
      </p>

      <p>
        They may encounter barriers related to language, mobility, or cultural differences. The app should provide accessible information and 
        resources to ensure that all users can navigate the city comfortably and safely. In addition, marginalized communities may face safety 
        concerns while exploring unfamiliar environments. The app could incorporate features such as safety tips, reviews highlighting inclusive 
        and welcoming sites.

        Interactive features in our web app.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user will first take a quiz on the website that prompts their interests and recommends places and locations, such as restaurants in
            Seattle that best fit their taste and needs or parks that are nice for family trips.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user can also use a saved list to customize the places they are interested in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users can also navigate to a linked webpage that has all the places and select the categories to filter their needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website also has a calendar where the user can customize their travel plan using their saved places list.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The user will be viewing the places that are notable in Seattle. The location (will be acquired using <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>),
        a picture (via various sources such as Google Images), relevant cost, description, etc., will be displayed to the user, as well as the calendar.
      </p>

      <p>
        The web app aims to address the problem faced by travelers who are unfamiliar with Seattle and are seeking guidance on 
        where to go. By providing personalized recommendations based on the user's interests through a quiz feature, the app ensures 
        that travelers can discover places that align with their preferences. Additionally, the ability to save calendars of 
        when they attending locations allows users to plan efficiently. The search bar filters options further enhances the user experience 
        by enabling them to explore all recommended places. Overall, this app serves as a solution by simplifying the process of discovering 
        and planning activities in Seattle, thereby enhancing the travel experience for users.
