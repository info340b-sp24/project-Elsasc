We all enjoyed our time so much that it hurts to hear that people feel like Seattle is a boring place with nothing to do. So we set out to change that. Our site includes a few fun features to look at. You can create a timeline, search and sort through our location list, like any cards you want to save for later, and finally feel free to take our quiz to see what tags you might want to search for first."
